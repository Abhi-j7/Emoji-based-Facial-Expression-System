Hey Viewer!!

This project is used to express your expressions based on emojis!. The main objective of this project is to develop a system which generates Emoji based on your facial Expression.
The project can be used to study different facial expressions that a machine can understand & also can be used as filters in social media applications such as Snapchat, Instagram, 
facebook etc. 

There are differnet ways to communicate our feelings and emotions, which can be classified either by verbal or non-verbal means of communication. Facial expressions (non-verbal communication) are a 
great way of communication as which dosen't require any words to communicate with each other.
Coming to the project, This project is developed in python, Where the faces are recognized and based on the expression, emojis are generated respectively. Face is the input which can 
be given to the system either by using a web-cam or by uploading a image of PNG type in the system to generate an emoji based on the expressions provided!!
In this project, HAAR Cascade classifier is used to extract the expressions out from the face featured out. Now this classification done by SVM that is Support Vector Machine,
SVM is used to feature of face into expressions, and these expressions are converted into equivalent emojis. And there after these emojis are supperimposed as actual face expressions as mask.
Using HAAR of OpenCV package, corresponding emoji for an expression can be superimposed.
Hope You got an idea about my project with a happy emoji on your face :) !!
